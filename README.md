# Automobile-Sales-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python Pandas. The project focuses on analyzing automobile sales
sourced from Kaggle, utilizing google colab for coding.

# Overview
The dataset used in this project comprises approximately 3 thousand records of automobile sales spanning from 2018 t0 2020. The primary objective of the analysis is to perform EDA to gain insights into automobile sales.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data?select=Auto+Sales+data.csv

# Python Libraries Used
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

# Project Details
1. Data Cleaning: The initial step involves cleaning up the dataset to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
2. Data Analysis: The focus of the analysis is on automobile sales that took place in the year 2020. Various aspects of the sales data are explored, including revenue, profit, highest sales across countries, monthly sales trend, frequent customers, sales distribution deal size.
3. Visualization: The insights derived from the data analysis are visually represented using Seaborn and other visualization libraries. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate the findings.
4. Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of key insights and observations obtained from the EDA process.

# Usage
To run the Notebook file containing the code for this analysis, simply download the ipynb file and open it in google colab or any compatible environment.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own analysis projects!
